Rocket Lobby System was written by Dustin Priest, or by handle name "Rocket" (or "Gamer Rocket" at one point in the past).

This technology has been worked on for well over a year and has seen many revisions and improvements. It started as a library written for the JDA (Java Discord API).
A great friend of mine came up with the idea of making a library that was bindable to all languages so all api's could benefit with this technology. And I liked the idea.
